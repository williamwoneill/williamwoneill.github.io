Symptoms of mold illness affect many different body systems at once. Doctors who are unfamiliar with mold illness can think these people are crazy, and many get offered psychiatric treatments like antidepressants just because they have so many symptoms! Mold illness is always a multi-system and multi-symptom illness. 

Here’s a list of the most common mold symptoms:

*tremor, blurred vision, confusion, disorientation, word searching, memory loss, anxiety, depression, irritability, headaches,  numbness, tingling, vertigo, POTS, learning difficulty, fatigue, weakness, fevers, sweating, temperature dysregulation, thirst, weight gain or loss, chemical sensitivity, high histamine/hives, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, food sensitivities, appetite swings, frequent urination, joint pain, muscle pain, nerve pain, aching, morning stiffness, ice pick pain, muscle cramps, cough, shortness of breath, air hunger, sinus problems, sleep issues, exercise intolerance*

Mold illness can look like many other diseases, and can overlap with other diseases, too. For example, a pituitary tumor can cause the same symptoms as mold illness. We never want to treat the wrong thing!  Mold illness can cause other diseases as well. A common example is when mold illness drives autoimmune disease.  In these cases, treating the mold illness will often bring autoimmune disease into remission. If it’s well-entrenched, though, the autoimmune disease needs to be treated separately at the same time.

Having a doctor who knows how to sort out the difference (do you have one that looks like the other, or do you have both?) makes the difference in your ability to get better.
