Walls, floors, ceilings, hard-surface (including wood, laminate, MDF, leather or vinyl) furniture, leather shoes, musical instruments, photo frames, glass and metal objects, laptops and similar items can be cleaned with: 
- __Homemade Everclear spray__:  Everclear (grain alcohol from the liquor store) in one part to 8 parts water, in a spray bottle.
- __Homemade Dawn/vinegar spray__: one quart of water with 6 drops of Dawn original dish soap and 2 T of white vinegar (you may also use lemon juice) in a spray bottle. This is particularly good for bacteria in an environment, like actinomycetes, which can be tested for along with mold in an environment.
- __Shockwave__ is a product that will work on both bacteria and viruses as well as mold, and although it’s a chemical-based product it doesn’t have a strong smell. Many of my patients who are chemically sensitive do fine with it. 
-Benefect is another cleaning solution that is made with thyme oil. Thyme is a powerful antimicrobial, and to some degree will work on mold. I recommend using it after Everclear spray to make sure the mold is fully taken care of. Benefect smells good, and also does not bother many chemically-sensitive people.

For any of these cleaning solutions, spray a dry cloth (Swiffer cloths work well) until damp and wipe down surfaces  until the cloth becomes dry. Use a second wet solution (for example, Dawn/vinegar followed by Everclear, or Everclear followed by Benefect). Then wipe again with a clean, dry cloth.  Throw away the cloths by placing them in a plastic bag. If you are using reusable cloths, wash them right away in a washing machine using hot water.

If remediation has been done in a home, it’s best to HEPA-vacuum all walls, floors, and ceilings, spray and wipe them down with some of the options above, and then HEPA-vacuum again. 

__NOTE__: It is always best to have someone other than the sick person do this cleaning process, whenever possible!  Cleaning does further expose you.  Masking up, wearing gloves, and ventilation (outdoor air) will help if this is not an option.
