    Clothes and other fabric items that have been exposed to mold can usually be cleaned if they are able to go in the washing machine. If able, use a hot water wash. Sometimes repeated washing is necessary.

I like using [Borax](https://amzn.to/3kwGmKQ){:target="_blank"} and white vinegar in the laundry. But any [unscented laundry soap](https://amzn.to/3bIlkVE){:target="_blank"} should be fine, especially if you use the following hacks:

My favorite hack for laundry that has been in a moldy environment is to use [Cascade Complete dishwasher pods](https://amzn.to/37W5CFl){:target="_blank"}. Throw one directly on top of your clothes, and start the wash.  This product contains an enzyme that breaks down mycotoxins so that you don’t have to wash a load so many times. 

[An ozone attachment for your washing machine is also available](https://amzn.to/3r34mrF){:target="_blank"}. This also helps rid clothes of mycotoxins. At first, it’s a good idea to run items through a few times. Later, it helps to keep toxins levels low just by using it with your regular day-to-day laundry.

Many people with biotoxin illness react poorly to scented laundry soaps and dryer sheets. I think of these as poisons to the brain! Please avoid them if possible.
