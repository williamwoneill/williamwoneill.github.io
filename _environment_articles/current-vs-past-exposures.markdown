## You may have been exposed long ago

I like all my new patients to fill out an environmental history timeline. Sometimes living or working in a moldy environment long ago may be the reason you are sick now. This is especially true for people who have one or more of the HLA-DR gene types that are associated with an inability to tag and remove biotoxins, meaning that they can continue to circulate in your body years later. 

It is important to consider both past and present exposures from a car, school, work, gym, church, or someone else’s home, and avoid these places during treatment.  

Also, please keep in mind that just because no one else got sick in a place where you did does not mean that there wasn’t mold there. Some people can handle environmental mold, or get better once they leave because they don’t have the detox problems you might. You might also have been able to handle moldy buildings earlier in your life but something happened- a health problem, a pregnancy, a car accident, a tick-borne infection, a chronic virus- and now your inflammation is out of control and you can no longer tolerate this type of toxicity.  The goal with treatment is to get you back to being able to tolerate a moldy environment like you used to.
